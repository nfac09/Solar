            <h2>About the Club</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Solar Flying Club! We’re a group of aviation enthusiasts who share a passion for flying. Solar Flying Club's mission is to stimulate and encourage interest in the study of aviation through a cooperative, safe and economical environment for all active members. We are a non-profit, equity ownership club who own, fly and maintain a Cessna 172M, an IFR-capable aircraft available for everything from a short local tour or lunch outing to extended trips located at Ankeny Regional Airport (KIKV) in Ankeny, Iowa.</p>

            <h3>Mission and Vision</h3>
            <p>At Solar Flying Club, we’re more than just a group of pilots – we’re a family. Our vision is to build a close-knit community around the plane we all proudly own, sharing our collective love for aviation. We believe that flying brings people together, and our vision is to create an environment where members can connect, learn, and grow through their shared passion for the skies.</p>

            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <p>We have a rich history that dates back to September 17, 1953, when three passionate pilots – Howard Heidman, Claude Gaskins, and John Beaman – came together to form a social flying club. With an initial membership fee of just $35, they started the club to promote camaraderie and fellowship among pilots in Central Iowa. We’ve grown a lot since then, but we’ve always stayed true to our roots.</p>

            <h3>About Ankeny Regional Airport (KIKV)</h3>
            <p>Ankeny Regional Airport opened in 1994 and serves as a reliever airport to Des Moines International Airport (KDSM). It’s a fantastic facility with a full-service FBO, Exec1 Aviation, Inc, offering aircraft maintenance, rental, car rental, primary flight training, and charter services. It’s the perfect home for our club.</p>
